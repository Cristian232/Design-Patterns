        Definition:
            Prototype is a creational design pattern that allows cloning objects, even complex ones,
            without coupling to their specific classes.

        Use:

        Example: How_to

            Step 1: Implement Cloneable to GameUnit and override clone method
            Step 2: In clone() method, return a shallow copy with cast GameUnit and super.clone()
                    also call method initialize before returning
            Step 3: Add initialize method() with void return type and that sets this position to Point3D.Zero and calls reset method
            Step 4: Add reset method abstract void
            Step 5: In general Override, clone with CloneNotSupportedException and reset with throw new UnsupportedOperationException
            Step 6: In swordsman Override reset() with status idle

        In main:
            Swordsman s1 = new Swordsman();
            s1.move(new Point3D(-10,0,0),20);
            s1.atack();

            System.out.println(s1);
            Swordsman s2 = (Swordsman) s1.clone();
            System.out.println("Cloned " + s2);

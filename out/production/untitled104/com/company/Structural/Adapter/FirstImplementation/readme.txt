        Definition:
            Using Adapter pattern we make existing object work with cx, by adapting to cx expected interface
            Also called wrapper as it wraps existing object

        Use:
            Existing object that provides the func cx needs, but cx code expects a obj with a diff interface

        Example: How_to

            Step 1: Create a Class for Adapter
            Step 2: Adapter must implement interface expected by the client
            Step 3: In Class Adapter implementation, we are going to forward a method inherited from adaptee
            Step 4: In Object Adapter, we are going to implement the target interface and accept adaptee as constructor arg
            Step 5:
            Step 6:
            Step 7:
            Step 8:

        In main:
